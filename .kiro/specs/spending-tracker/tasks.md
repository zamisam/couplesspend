# Implementation Plan

## Testing Guidelines

- **Async Test Functions**: Always add `async` to test function signatures when planning to test them individually. For example:

  ```swift
  // Instead of:
  func testAddExpense() {
      // ... test implementation
  }

  // Use:
  func testAddExpense() async {
      // ... test implementation
  }
  ```
